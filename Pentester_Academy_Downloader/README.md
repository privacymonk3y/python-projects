# Pentester Academy Course Downloader

This is a script I wrote while learning python.
I got a bit tired of clicking through every link on PA to download and save the files.
This script will ask you for your cookie, a course ID and then start it's magic.

Due to me moving on from the project I've yet to come back and refractor it.

# Known issues
There has so far been one course, a earlier one, that had mostly the same file names.
This causes the downloader to repeatedly overwrite the files.
This was only on one course but just a heads up.

# Usage
`python ./PA_downloader.py`

You will be prompted for your "SACSID Cookie". This can be found by logging into PA.
Hit F12 to bring up Web Developer Tools.
Under Storage tab you will find the cookie like so...

Double click on the value field and copy/paste this into the command prompt.


After this you'll be asked for the course id which you can after clicking on the course you're interested in.
The "course?id=1" in the URL example below would just need to be 1 at the prompt.

That's all there is to it!
*Now just sit back and watch the downloader do it's thing.*


# To-Do
- refractor code
- implement a better check system so files don't overwrite existing files.
