# Welcome to my python projects
Where I put my monk3y made python tools / scripts!
---

**[PentesterAcademy Downloader]** - "**PA_playground.py**"
```plaintext
This is a version one of my downloader.
Built while learning python and will improve over time.
It will download all videos and files that are not lab links, ect.
I've used it for a couple months without issue.
```


**[Monk3y-Bof]** - "**monk3y_bof.py**"

```plaintext
Created this to have everything in one place.
It's a Buffer Overflow cookie cutter with multiple options.
Just delete or comment out the lines you don't need.

-note: python2
```
