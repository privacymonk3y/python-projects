# Requirements
Install TKinter (Debian)  
`sudo apt install python3-tk`

Installing requirements  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run GUI script  
`python3 pdf-crack-gui.py`

# Info
While I was doing Pentester Academy I found modules to brute force pdfs with python 2.  
This was interesting to me and at the time I was mid course which was using TKinter.  
I decided to accept the challenge of taking what I learned and convert it into Python3 & GUI.

There is a demo dictionary included, and the password protected pdf.  
You can brute force it with the included dictionary or create your own with the rules below.

# PDF Cracking

If you wish to make your own wordless for the test files the rules are:

1.) Password is 5 characters long

2.) Password only contains characters from character set ( x, y, z, Z, 1)


# Notes

This is pretty rough. Please let me know any errors.
Pictures and documentation about what caused it.

Thank you,
