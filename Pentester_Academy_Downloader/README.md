# Pentester Academy Course Downloader

This is a script I wrote while learning python.
I got a bit tired of clicking through every link on PA to download and save the files.
This script will ask you for your cookie, a course ID and then start it's magic.

Due to me moving on from the project I've yet to come back and refractor it.

# Known issues
There has so far been one course, a earlier one, that had mostly the same file names.
This causes the downloader to repeatedly overwrite the files.
This was only on one course but just a heads up.

# Usage
python ./PA_downloader.py

You will be prompted for your "SACSID Cookie". This can be found here.

After this you'll be asked for the course id which you can find here.

*just watch the downloader do it's thing.*


# To-Do
- refractor code
- implement a better check system so files don't overwrite existing files.
