# OSCP BoF Cheat sheet Scripts

This script is just something I created to have all of what I need in one place.
It's a cheat sheet / working script. You run it and comment out sections of the code as you progress.
This project is written in python2 to help simplify the formatting.

Converting to python3 may and probably will cause problems because of the changes between 2 and 3.

There are some work arounds to this if you are really committed to making it python3 :)
